			<h3>How to Use</h3>
			<p>
				This simulation generates samples to simulate what player <br />
				can get from opening prize boxes in Spiral Knights.<br /><br />
				<strong>Attempts: </strong><br />
				To simulate how many boxes opened in a single sample. <br />
				(Usually preferring 1, 5 or 14 boxes but it's not fixed here)<br /><br />
				<strong>Samples: </strong><br />
				To repeat the attempt(s) to open the boxes.<br /><br />
				<strong>Win Percentage: </strong><br />
				The grand chance to get into a certain prize pool.<br />
				(Total sum MUST be 100)<br /><br />
				<strong>Prize: </strong><br />
				The item name of the prize, but doesn't need to be real.<br /><br />
				<strong>References: </strong><br />

		<p><strong>Note: </strong>I tried my best to simulate the calcuation of the prize distributions in boxes, in or other than Spiral Knights, the result MAY be different from those calculated by actual game algorithms. This is only a simulation that let you to get an idea of what you would get by opening boxes than/before you would buy one or more. I bear no responsibilities for the accuracy between my calcuation and the game result. Anyway, enjoy the simulation! -Zatroco</p>
