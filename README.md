Current Projects {
  Spiral Knights Prize Boxes Simulator: 
    Version: 1.0;
    URL: http://zatroco.nhz.hk/SK_Boxes_Simulator.html;
    Description: "This simulator provides a platform for the user to simulate prize pools with one or more rewards in it and their percentage chance. This platform also provides samples and attempts in each and represented with a table. Sizes are dynamic and I do believe this could be applied into other games as well.";
